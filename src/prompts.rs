    When you need multiple independent pieces of information, call all relevant tools simultaneously \
    in a single turn rather than sequentially — this is faster and avoids wasting context. \
    Keep your final result concise, evidence-based, and grounded in the code. \
    Include file paths and line numbers when relevant. \
    Do not ask follow-up questions. When you are done, call finish with your final result."
